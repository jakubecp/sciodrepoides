# Sciodrepoides watsoni development
##Ecology and development of sciodrepoides watsoni larvae

* distribution model of S. watsoni larvae
* developmental model of S. watsoni larvae
* instar size of S. watsoni larvae

I still have adults from experiment. I could sex them and measure their size according to the temperature where they were.
I would like to improve maps with code from sgem article1 (higher resolution=nicer maps)
Maybe it would be nice to enhance dataset and use spocc package for data search (broader spectrum of sources)
